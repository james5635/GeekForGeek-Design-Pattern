## Common Naming Conventions
```plaintext
m_ -> Member variable (most common in C++) (m_value, m_name)
s_ -> Static variable (s_instance, s_counter)
g_ -> Global variable (g_config, g_database)
k -> Constant (kMaxValue, kMinSize)
```

## Key Concept
- Storage class specifiers (auto, register, static, thread_local, extern, mutable)
- Scope
- Storage Duration
- Linkage
- Memory Location
